//Exercise 1
	int + int = sum 
//Exercise 2
	if (int/2) = whole number
	then int is even else is odd
//Exercise 3	
	Input 5 separate numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
	average = calculate (1+2+3+4+5)/5
	Print "The smallest number is " min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and Print "The largest number is " max(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) which should be 1 and 5 respectively
	Print ("The average is " average) which should equal 5
